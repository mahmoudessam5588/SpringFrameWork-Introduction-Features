# Spring FrameWork Features:
## A) Inversion Of Control(ICP):

- it's nothing more than giving the control to the framework itself
- consider creating a thousand of classes every time you create an object of these classes and destroying them it's a tedious process to do and for garbage collection to handle
- so we are giving the control to the framework itself it's done by spring embrace the concept of **_Dependency Injection_**

## B) Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP):

- AOP It's nothing more than tackling down the cross-cutting concerns
- As you building your application there are a lot of things that might do repeatedly like (logging , securities, etc)these types of actions that require every request to go to the server
- so we separate all cross-cutting concerns, and we separate them out using the spring AOP

## C) Spring Web Application (Spring MVC):

## D) Spring JDBC + Hibernate (When Working With Databases):
